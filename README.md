# Prerequisites

Note that the prerequisites of `beavy` need to be satisfied. You can find them
in the [`beavy` docs](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/tree/main/docs) e.g. [for Linux](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/main/docs/linux_dependencies.md).

# To build:

## Cargo:

With `cargo` installed, you can simply run:
```
cargo run
```
which will both build and then run the game.
